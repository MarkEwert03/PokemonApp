# Pokémon Team Builder

## 2022W2 CPSC210 Project by Mark Ewert

In this project I am aiming to create a program that
will allow users to create a team of up to six pokémon.
Users will be able to pick from a wide varitey of species,
and can then customize the specific ones they chose in
minor ways.

**Some elements I would like to include are**
- Changable nicknames for the Pokémon
- Reordering of the team list
- A rendering of the trainer and the Pokémon team
- Possibly changable moves/abilities of the Pokémon
- Possibly provide statics about the team composition

This project is meant to be a source of entertainment
and as an application for anybody who is interested in
Pokémon. It could either be used to devise a possible
team for battling, or just to try out different combinations

I enjoy playing video games and Pokémon is one of my
favourite series, so this idea came naturally. I am very
excited to combine two of my passions into this project,
Pokémon and programming, and I look forward to completing
it!
